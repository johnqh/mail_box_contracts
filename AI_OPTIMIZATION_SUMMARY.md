## 📊 Current System Status

### ✅ What's Working
- **105 EVM tests passing** - Full contract functionality tested
- **TypeScript builds successfully** - All clients compile
- **Multi-chain integration complete** - Both EVM and Solana work
- **Unified API functional** - Single client works with any wallet
- **Automatic detection working** - Chain type detected from wallets

### 🎯 AI Development Ready
- Clear patterns for all common tasks
- Comprehensive error handling guidance
- Testing approaches documented
- Quick reference for immediate productivity
- Context files for rapid understanding

## 🧠 Key AI Development Patterns

### 1. Unified Client Pattern
```typescript
// Single client works with ANY wallet type
const client = new UnifiedMailBoxClient(wallet, config);
console.log('Chain:', client.getChainType()); // Auto-detected
await client.sendMessage("Hello!", "Multi-chain message", true);
```

### 2. Dynamic Import Pattern
```typescript
// Load chain-specific modules only when needed
const evmModules = await import('../evm');
const solanaModules = await import('../solana');
```

### 3. Error Handling Pattern
```typescript
try {
  const result = await operation();
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  const message = error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error);
  throw new Error(`Operation failed: ${message}`);
}
```

### 4. Testing Pattern
```typescript
describe('Multi-chain feature', () => {
  it('should work on EVM', async () => {
    const evmClient = new UnifiedMailBoxClient(evmWallet, config);
    expect(evmClient.getChainType()).to.equal('evm');
  });
  
  it('should work on Solana', async () => {
    const solanaClient = new UnifiedMailBoxClient(solanaWallet, config);
    expect(solanaClient.getChainType()).to.equal('solana');
  });
});
```

## 🔧 Essential Commands for AI

```bash
# Always run these in sequence after contract changes
npm run compile    # Regenerate TypeScript types from contracts
npm run build      # Build all TypeScript clients
npm test          # Run comprehensive test suite

# Specific test suites
npm run test:evm      # 105 EVM contract tests
npm run test:unified  # Unified client tests

# Deployment
npm run deploy:local     # Local EVM deployment
npm run deploy:unified   # Multi-chain deployment
```
