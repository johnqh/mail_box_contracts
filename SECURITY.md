# Security Advisory

## Current Security Status

This document outlines known security vulnerabilities and their risk assessment for the MailBox Contracts project.

### High Severity Vulnerabilities (as of 2025-09-02)

#### 1. bigint-buffer Buffer Overflow (GHSA-3gc7-fjrx-p6mg)
- **Severity**: High (CVSS 7.7)
- **Affected Package**: `bigint-buffer` (dependency of `@solana/spl-token`)
- **Impact**: Potential application crash via buffer overflow in `toBigIntLE()` function
- **Status**: No patch available
- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - **Production Risk**: LOW - Function not directly used in our codebase
  - **Development Risk**: MEDIUM - Could affect development tools
- **Mitigation**: Monitor for updates to @solana/spl-token that address this vulnerability

#### 2. cookie Out of Bounds Characters (GHSA-pxg6-pf52-xh8x)
- **Severity**: High
- **Affected Package**: `cookie` (dependency of Hardhat via @sentry/node)
- **Impact**: Accepts cookie data with out of bounds characters
- **Status**: No fix available
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **Production Risk**: NONE - Only affects development tooling
  - **Development Risk**: LOW - Limited exposure in development environment

#### 3. tmp Symbolic Link Vulnerability (GHSA-52f5-9888-hmc6)
- **Severity**: High 
- **Affected Package**: `tmp` (dependency of `solc`)
- **Impact**: Arbitrary file/directory write via symbolic link manipulation
- **Status**: No fix available
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **Production Risk**: NONE - Only affects build/compilation process
  - **Development Risk**: MEDIUM - Could affect local development security

### Low Severity Vulnerabilities
- **Count**: 15 low severity vulnerabilities
- **Primary Sources**: Development dependencies (Hardhat ecosystem)
- **Risk Assessment**: Minimal impact on production security

## Security Recommendations

### For Production Deployments
1. **Smart Contracts**: No vulnerabilities affect deployed smart contracts
2. **Client Libraries**: Monitor @solana/spl-token updates for bigint-buffer fixes
3. **Runtime Security**: Current vulnerabilities do not affect production runtime

### For Development Environment
1. **Isolation**: Run development tools in isolated environments
2. **Updates**: Regularly check for security updates to development dependencies
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor GitHub Advisory Database for new vulnerabilities

### For CI/CD Pipeline
1. **Dependency Scanning**: Current security scan implemented and passing
2. **Audit Frequency**: Run `npm audit` on every build
3. **Breaking Changes**: Evaluate security fixes that require breaking changes

## Vulnerability Response Process

1. **Detection**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact on production vs development
3. **Prioritization**: Address production-affecting vulnerabilities immediately
4. **Communication**: Document all security decisions in this file
5. **Monitoring**: Track upstream fixes and apply when available
